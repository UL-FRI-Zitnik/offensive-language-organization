Passive transport relies on the kinetic energy of the substance that is being transported. This kinetic energy is what causes it to move around and (by random chance) cross the membrane. The difference is that active transport actually uses the cell's energy (ATP or electrochemical gradient) to pump the substance across the membrane.\n",

Now the fact that he lied multiple times in front of the Senate and read a speech that could seriously have been written by a 5th grader was pretty fucking repulsive and for that reason alone the GOP should have ditched him.
